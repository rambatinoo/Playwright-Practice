# Playwright Practice

Welcome to my Playwright practice repository! This is where I experiment with and develop Playwright tests. Feel free to explore the functions and tests here, and try running any that catch your interest.

## Installation

To get started, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### As this is made for practicing there may be additional instructions inside individual files
